On this project, I created a real-time chat application that allows different users to chat. I used Socket.io to manage real-time WebSocket connections to a Node.js server. It will allow you to communicate in real-time chat messages with all clients connected to a single server.

On this entire project, I only used JavaScript(NodeJS to backend and ReactJS to frontend).

By the end of this project, I was able to get a better understanding of how to send and receive messages using WebSockets and Socket.io to make any real-time application.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting the Frontend

Open an other window on your terminal, go to Web's folder and install the dependencies:

```bash

```

To run the application use:

```bash
yarn start
```

## ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Did you have any problems with the installation?

- Make sure that you have Node installed in your machine.

```bash
Solution: Install Node
```
- Assure that you have `Yarn` or `NPM` installed in your machine.

```bash
Solution: Install Yarn or NPM
```
- A dependency called Nodemon in the package.json file(Backend) should be there.

```bash
Solution: Install Nodemon as a dependency on project.
```
- Faleid comunication between frontend and backend?

```bash
Solution: Set a empty PORT on beckend.Them go to frontend/src/pages/chat and fix the ENDPOINT = 'NEW_PORT';
```

## üéØ Bonus

If you completed all the steps successfully, you are finished with the installation, congrats! 
The application should now be running in your localhost and I have a bonus for you, if you want to chat with someone, the deploy has already been made and you can access it through the WebPage.
