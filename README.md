In this project I created a real time chat application that allow differents users to chat. I used Socket.io to manage real time WebSocket connections to a Node.js server.
It will allow you to communicate real time chat messages with all clients connected to a single server.

This entire project I used only JavaScript(`NodeJS` to backend and `ReactJS` to frontend).

By the end of this project I could get a strong understanding of how to send and receive messages using WebSockets and `Socket.io` to make any real time application.
